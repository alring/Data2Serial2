Data2Serial2
=============

Data2Serial is a serial port communicator, a **terminal** of some sorts. Designed primarily for embedded system testing, main purpose is to sending text files faster as strings or byte arrays.

This is the more stable, _hopefully_ faster version of [Data2Serial](https://github.com/theaob/Data2Serial). The aim is to have no warnings from Visual Studio Code Analysis.
